# Supervised-Learning
This project is a supervised learning, classification problem with multiple classes.  In this project, we will compare and contrast the performance of three different learning models on a common and publicly available dataset.

This project depends on the following libraries.  Make sure you have them installed.

* scipy
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* scikit-learn



We will use the iris flowers dataset, which contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements and the species of flower observed.  Only three species are present in this dataset.

The data os loaded directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Implementing the following supervised machine learning algorithms

Logistic Regression (LR)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
